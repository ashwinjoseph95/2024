                Humans can perceive social cues and the interaction context of another human to infer
                the internal states including cognitive and emotional states, empathy, and intention. This
                unique ability to infer internal states leads to effective social interaction between humans
                desirable in many intelligent systems such as collaborative and social robots, and humanmachine
                interaction systems. However, it is challenging for machines to perceive human
                states under noisy real-world settings, which are usually measured by noninvasive sensors.
                Recent works investigating the potential solutions for the estimation of human states under controlled
                conditions using facial features with the off-the-shelf camera by leveraging
                deep learning methods. This workshop aims to bring interdisciplinary researchers across
                computer vision, artificial intelligence, robotics, and human-computer interaction together
                to share current research achievements and discuss future research directions for human
                behavior and state understanding, and their potential application, especially in the wild
                environment. Specifically, we are interested in cognition-aware computing by integrating
                environment contexts and multi-modal nonverbal social cues not limited to gaze interaction, body
                language and para language. More importantly, we extend multi-modal human
                behavior research to infer the internal states of humans. This is a challenging problem yet
                important to realize effective interaction between humans and intelligent systems.

            <p class="mb-0">It is desirable for intelligent systems like robots, virtual agents, human-machine
                interfaces to collaborate and interact seamlessly with humans in the era of Industry 5.0, where
                intelligent systems must work alongside humans to perform a variety of tasks anywhere at home,
                factories, offices, transit, etc. The underlying technologies to achieve efficient and intelligent
                collaboration between humans and ubiquitous intelligent systems can be realized by cooperative
                intelligence, spanning interdisciplinary studies between robotics, AI,
                human-robot and -computer interaction, computer vision, cognitive science, etc. </p>
            <p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main considerations to achieve cooperative intelligence
                between humans and
                intelligent systems is to enable everyone and everything to know each other well, like how humans can
                trust or infer the implicit internal states like intention, emotion, and cognitive states of each other.
                The importance of empathy to facilitate human-robot interaction has been highlighted in previous studies
                . However, it is difficult for intelligent systems to estimate the internal states of humans
                because they are dependent on the complex social dynamics and environment contexts. This requires
                intelligent systems to be capable of sensing the multi-modal inputs,
                reasoning the underlying abstract knowledge, and generating the corresponding responses to collaborate
                and interact with humans.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many studies on estimating internal states of humans
                through measurements of
                wearables and non-invasive sensors, but it would be difficult to implement these solutions in
                the wild because of the additional sensors to be worn by humans. One promising solution is to use
                audiovisual data like nonverbal behavior cues consisting of gaze interaction, facial expression, body
                language and paralanguage to infer the internal states of humans. Researchers in cognitive and social
                psychology have long advocated that these nonverbal behaviors are subconsciously generated by humans and
                reflect the internal states of humans under different contexts. Some salient examples are the studies on
                emotion recognition using facial and body language in controlled environment. It remains an
                open question for intelligent systems to sense and recognize nonverbal cues and reason the implicit rich
                underlying internal states of humans in the wild and noisy environments.</p>

                sensing and
                recognition of
                nonverbal cues and internal states in the wild to realize cooperative intelligence between humans and
                intelligent systems. We gather researchers from different expertise, yet having the common goal,
                motivation, and resolve to explore and tackle this delicate issue considering the practicality of
                industrial applications. We are calling for papers to discuss novel methods to realize human-robot
                cooperative intelligence by sensing and understanding humans’ behavior, internal states, and to generate
                empathetic interactions. </p>
